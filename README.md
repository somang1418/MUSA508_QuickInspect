##### Description 

In the final project, we build a predictive model based on various risk factors, including a number of 311 requests, presence of food amenities, and nearest neighbor distances to the above mentioned. We analyze the performance of our model across different neighborhoods, race groups, and establishment types. We also conduct a cost benefit analysis to examine economic impacts.
